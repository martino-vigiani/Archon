# Privacy Policy

**Archon - Multi-Agent Development Orchestration**

**Last Updated:** [DATE]

---

## Overview

Archon is a desktop command-line interface (CLI) application designed for multi-agent development orchestration. This Privacy Policy explains how Archon handles your data.

**The short version:** Archon does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data. Everything runs locally on your machine.

---

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

**Nothing.** Archon does not collect any personal information, usage data, analytics, or telemetry of any kind.

- No user accounts or registration required
- No personal information requested or stored
- No usage analytics or tracking
- No crash reports sent to external servers
- No advertising or marketing data collection

### Local Data Storage

Archon stores operational data locally on your machine in the `.orchestra/` directory within your project folder. This data includes:

- Configuration files you create
- Agent definitions and prompts
- Session logs and workflow history
- Project-specific settings

**This data never leaves your computer** unless you explicitly choose to share it (e.g., by committing it to a version control repository).

## Third-Party Services

### Claude API (Anthropic)

Archon integrates with the Claude Code CLI, which connects to Anthropic's Claude API. When you use Archon:

- Your prompts and code context are sent to Anthropic's servers for AI processing
- Anthropic's own privacy policy governs how they handle this data
- You must have your own Claude Code CLI configured with your API credentials
- Archon does not access, store, or transmit your API keys

For information about how Anthropic handles your data, please review:
- [Anthropic's Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)
- [Anthropic's Terms of Service](https://www.anthropic.com/terms)

### No Other Third-Party Services

Archon does not integrate with any other third-party services, advertising networks, analytics platforms, or data brokers.

---

## Data Security

Since Archon operates entirely locally:

- All configuration and operational data remains on your machine
- Data security depends on your local machine's security measures
- No data transmission means no risk of interception during transfer
- You maintain complete control over all stored data

---

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:

- **Access:** All data is stored locally in readable formats
- **Deletion:** Delete the `.orchestra/` directory to remove all Archon data
- **Portability:** Copy your local files to any other machine
- **Modification:** Edit configuration files directly as needed

### GDPR Compliance

For users in the European Economic Area (EEA):

Since Archon does not collect or process personal data, most GDPR provisions do not apply. However, we affirm that:

- No personal data is collected or processed by Archon
- No data is transferred outside your local machine
- No consent is required as no data collection occurs
- You may delete all local data at any time

---

## Children's Privacy

Archon does not collect any personal information from anyone, including children under the age of 13. The application is intended for software developers and does not target children.

---

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Since Archon is distributed as open-source software, policy changes will be visible in the project repository.
